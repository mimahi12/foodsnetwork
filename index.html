            <h2> My Recipies </h2>
            <p> Usher in the fall season with a warm pan of (almost too) easy apple cobbler. For this simple and
                delicious apple dessert, peeling and slicing the fruit will be the bulk of your workload. The
                combination of brown sugar and apples yields an exceptionally gooey-rich filling that was made to team
                up with a buttery, golden crust and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. </p>

                <h2>Recipies title</h2>
                <p>I remembered the smell that would drift over the yard as whiting fillets coated in flour hit the hot
                    oil, and I could see my dad’s or uncles’ hands (they cooked in shifts) using a spatula to retrieve
                    the cooked fillets out of the cast-iron caldron over a fire in the hazy heat of late August.

                <p>Nothing chases away the chill like a cozy bowl of soup or stew. From meaty chili and hearty beef stew
                    to creamy corn soup and New England clam chowder — you'll find all the recipes you need to stay nice
                    and warm.</p>

                <h2>Recipies title</h2>
                <p>You know what sounds like delicious lunch? A big salad. But is it just us, or do they always leave us
                    wanting more two hours later? Since a bunch of lettuce just won’t cut it, try adding a boost of
                    protein to your next bowl. Aside from keeping you satisfied longer, it’s essential to
                    muscle-building, hormone production and energy (and you can get it from grains, vegetables and
                    fruits in addition to the usual meat or tofu).</p>
